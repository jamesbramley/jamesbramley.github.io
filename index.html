        <h2>Game Development Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio! My name is James Bramley and I am curently a 4th Year student at
            Durham University studying Computer Science. I have over 2 and a half years of experience using the Unity
            Game Engine and C# to create both personal and university projects. This website is a portfolio of some of
            these projects. I have recently picked up Unreal Engine 4 but am yet to develop any projects for it.

                <h3><b>2D Platformer</b></h3>

                <p>
                    During my 4th year at university I took a game development submodule. In this submodule I was tasked
                    with creating a game in which you collected 10 'treasures' around the Durham University campus. I
                    created a 2D platformer entitled 'Durham Quest V: Final Treasure Prologue'. The game uses a
                    traditional platformer design combined with a small hint of Metroidvania.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was developed by me over the course of 2 months, is completely finished and features 4
                    levels. My aim with this game was to keep the project scale low but have a polished final product.
                    As the game is quite short, I added a rank system that challenges players in order to add some
                    replay value. To get the best rank for a level you must collect all of its treasure while also
                    finishing in a quick time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The character design and UI elements were created by me, however other assets were taken from
                    pre-existing sources to save time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I felt this short project was a good for me as it gave me experience of creating and polishing a
                    full feature-complete game from start to finish.

                <h3><b>Tower Survival Game</b></h3>
                <p>
                    I came up with the idea for this game when I remembered some of the levels I used to play on
                    'LittleBigPlanet' for the Playstation 3. However, I wanted to add more depth and so in this game
                    I included a variety of gameplay elements like powerups and a slow-down time mechanic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective of the game is to reach as low as you can in the tower while avoiding the endless
                    stream of falling bombs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game features multiple playable characters each with different stats that affect the way they
                    play. To add some objective to the game, high scores are recorded and many things are locked at
                    first. The player must collect coins while they play with which they can purchase the extra
                    content like new characters, music tracks and environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While playing the game I realised its potential for multiplayer and so I added a local multiplayer
                    option for up to 4 friends to play at once. In the near future, I plan to implement online
                    multiplayer and release the game on Steam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of the character, bomb and UI assets were created by me. The music heard in the video is placeholder
                    music - 'Another Winter' by Anamanaguchi from Scott Pilgrim vs The World (PS3).

                <h3><b>Danganronpa Fan Game</b></h3>
                <p>
                    I am creating this game in collaboration with a friend.
                    This will eventually be a full-length 'fan game' based on the 'Danganronpa' series, in which
                    students trapped in a high school must murder each other to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game has been developing over the course of 2 years. Over these 2 years i've gained a lot of
                    experience working with others for programming the game, as well as recording music and dialogue, and
                    writing (and rewriting) the story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game features 16 unique main characters all designed and drawn by me. Almost all of the UI Elements were also created by me.
                    However in the video, only one of the characters is designed by me, the others are placeholders.
                    If you want to see the character designs I made, you can see them

                <h3><b>Virtual Reality</b></h3>
                <p>
                    For my 3rd year project at university, I decided to produce a VR experience. In addition to
                    producing an immersive experience, the aim of this project was to investigate different methods of
                    interaction, as well as the different activities/challenges that could be done in VR, in order to
                    see how they affect a user's immersion levels. This includes the effect things like nausea can have
                    on a player's immersion within VR and the ways they can be alleviated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project helped me gain an understanding of the inner workings of VR games and the things they
                    need to consider during development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project was produced in Unity, using the SteamVR plugin. You can find a log of my project's
                    progress over time (videos)

                <h3><b>Original Card Game</b></h3>
                <p><a href="rules.pdf"><b>Rulebook PDF</b></a></p>
                <p>
                    I came up with the idea to create a card game based around the Gaming Society my friends and I
                    attend at University. Initially I came up with the system for the game, then my friends and I
                    created over 200 cards with different effects and stats based on the in-jokes of our Gaming society.
                    The aesthetic we went for was 'extremely crude MS paint'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the cards were created, I made a virtual playing mat for the cards in which 2 players could
                    build decks and face off against each other. We held a tournament for it at our 24 hour Gaming
                    Society event. At the moment the functionality is that of a real life playing mat with a few
                    additional features, however when I have time in the future I intend to extend it into a fully
                    polished digital card game.
