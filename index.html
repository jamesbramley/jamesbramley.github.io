        <h2>Game Development Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 4th Year student at Durham University studying Computer Science. I have 2 and a half years of
            experience using the Unity Game Engine and C# to create both personal and university projects. This website
            is a portfolio of some of these projects. I have recently picked up Unreal Engine 4 but am yet to develop
            any projects for it.

                <p>
                    During my 4th year at university I took a game development submodule. In this submodule I was tasked
                    with creating a game in which you collected 10 'treasures' around the Durham University campus. I
                    created a 2D platformer entitled 'Durham Quest V: Final Treasure Prologue'. The game uses a
                    traditional platformer design combined with a hint of Metroidvania.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was developed by me over the course of 2 months, is completely finished and features 4
                    levels. My aim with this game was to keep the scale low but have a polished final product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The character design and UI elements were created by me, however other assets were taken from
                    pre-existing sources to save time.
