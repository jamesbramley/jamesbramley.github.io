        <p>
            Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio! My name is James Bramley and I am currently a 4th Year student at
            Durham University studying Computer Science. I have over 2 and a half years of experience using the Unity
            Game Engine and C# to create both personal and university projects. This website is a portfolio of some of
            these projects. I have recently picked up Unreal Engine 4 but am yet to develop any substantial projects for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each of the projects I have provided code examples for you to look at if you so desire.

                <p>
                    I came up with the idea for this game when I remembered some of the levels I used to play on
                    'LittleBigPlanet' for the Playstation 3. However, I wanted to add more depth and so in this game
                    I included a variety of gameplay elements like powerups and a slow-down time mechanic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game features multiple playable characters each with different stats that affect the way they
                    play. To add some objective to the game, high scores are recorded and many things are locked at
                    first. The player must collect coins while they play with which they can purchase the extra
                    content like new characters, music tracks and environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of the character, bomb and UI assets were created by me. The game started as a collaborative
                    project, but I have since gone solo. As such, some code was not done by me; the camera movement and
                    four of the bomb types were not coded by me, but everything else was.
                    The music heard in the video is placeholder
                    music - 'Another Winter' by Anamanaguchi from Scott Pilgrim vs The World (PS3).

                    I wanted to make a 3D racing game prototype as I am a fan of arcade racers and wanted to try my hand
                    at a genre of game I hadn't yet worked on.
                    Within Unity, there isn't a simple way to create and modify roads,
                    so I implemented some procedural mesh generation to make the racetrack easier to construct based on
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9RK6O2kOKo"><b>this Unite 2015 talk</b></a>.
                    I also created a camera movement system which adapts its position based on the speed and position of
                    the car, which helps give the game a sense of speed absent from a more static camera.
                    Car model taken from the Unity asset store.

                    I participated in Ludum Dare 46, where the theme was 'Keep it Alive'. I decided to go for a more
                    unique interpretation of the theme, where the objective is to keep a meme created by the user
                    'alive'.
                    The game was created by me in 48 hours including all code and assets.

                    I am creating this game in collaboration with a friend. I have worked on and contributed to almost
                    all parts of the code, including the dialogue systems, player-environment interactions,
                    UI, and XML structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game has been developing over the course of 2 years. Over these 2 years i've gained a lot of
                    experience working with others for programming the game, as well as recording music and dialogue, and
                    writing (and rewriting) the story. Due to the large scale of the game I had to take care when designing
                    systems that would scale well.

                    For my 3rd year project at university, I decided to produce a VR experience. In addition to
                    producing an immersive experience, the aim of this project was to investigate different methods of
                    interaction, as well as the different activities/challenges that could be done in VR, in order to
                    see how they affect a user's immersion levels. This includes the effect things like nausea can have
                    on a player's immersion within VR and the ways they can be alleviated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project helped me gain an understanding of the inner workings of VR games and the things they
                    need to consider during development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project was produced in Unity, using the SteamVR plugin. You can find a log of my project's
                    progress over time (videos).

                    During my 4th year at university I took a game development submodule. In this submodule I was tasked
                    with creating a game in which you collected 10 'treasures' around the Durham University campus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was developed by me over the course of 2 months, is completely finished and features 4
                    levels. My aim with this game was to keep the project scale low but have a polished final product.
                    As the game is quite short, I added a rank system that challenges players in order to add some
                    replay value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The character design and UI elements were created by me, however other assets were taken from
                    pre-existing sources to save time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I felt this short project was a good for me as it gave me experience of creating and polishing a
                    full feature-complete game from start to finish.

                <p>
                    During the 2020 lockdown and the absence of football, I found myself wanting to create a football
                    simulation game that was a happy medium between the involved nature of Football Manager and the less
                    in-depth FIFA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a system that simulates games based on the stats of different players. In a match, the
                    football pitch is split into a 7x3 grid, within which players can move. Players make decisions and
                    perform actions based on their stats, the position of the ball, their team's current formation,
                    and the positions of their teammates. Better players make better decisions and execute actions more
                    successfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To save inputting data for 200 teams and ~5000 players, I generate them from databases of city
                    names, countries, first names, and surnames. I gave all of the players randomly assigned values for
                    each of their attributes, based on an initial 'player quality' and using a Gaussian distribution.

                    I participated in Brackey's Game Jam, where the theme was 'Rewind'. I wasn't particularly fond of
                    the theme, but I managed to create a small game where the player has to 'rewind' a broken clock to
                    the correct time. I felt this was a good experience for me as it allowed me to complete a game
                    where I wasn't totally passionate about the idea.

                    I came up with the idea to create a card game based around the Gaming Society my friends and I
                    attend at University. Initially I came up with the system for the game, then my friends and I
                    created over 200 cards with different effects and stats based on the in-jokes of our Gaming society.
                    The aesthetic we went for was 'extremely crude MS paint'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the cards were created, I made a virtual playing mat for the cards in which 2 players could
                    build decks and face off against each other. We held a tournament for it at our 24 hour Gaming
                    Society event. At the moment the functionality is that of a real life playing mat with a few
                    additional features.
