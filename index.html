        <h2>Game Development Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio! I am a 4th Year student at Durham University studying Computer
            Science. I have over 2 and a half years of experience using the Unity Game Engine and C# to create both
            personal and university projects. This website is a portfolio of some of these projects. I have recently
            picked up Unreal Engine 4 but am yet to develop
            any projects for it.

                <p>
                    During my 4th year at university I took a game development submodule. In this submodule I was tasked
                    with creating a game in which you collected 10 'treasures' around the Durham University campus. I
                    created a 2D platformer entitled 'Durham Quest V: Final Treasure Prologue'. The game uses a
                    traditional platformer design combined with a small hint of Metroidvania.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was developed by me over the course of 2 months, is completely finished and features 4
                    levels. My aim with this game was to keep the project scale low but have a polished final product.
                    As the game is quite short, I added a rank system that challenges players in order to add some
                    replay value. To get the best rank for a level you must collect all of its treasure while also
                    finishing in a quick time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The character design and UI elements were created by me, however other assets were taken from
                    pre-existing sources to save time.

                <p><a href="rules.pdf"><b>Rulebook PDF</b></a></p>
                <p>
                    I came up with the idea to create a card game based around the Gaming Society my friends and I
                    attend at University. Initially I came up with the system for the game, then my friends and I
                    created over 200 cards with different effects and stats based on the in-jokes of our Gaming society.
                    The aesthetic we went for was 'extremely crude MS paint'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the cards were created, I made a virtual playing mat for the cards in which 2 players could
                    build decks and face off against each other. We held a tournament for it at our 24 hour Gaming
                    Society event. At the moment the functionality is that of a real life playing mat with a few
                    additional features, however when I have time in the future I intend to extend it into a fully
                    polished digital card game.

                    I am creating this game in collaboration with a friend.
                    This will eventually be a full-length 'fan game' based on the 'Danganronpa' series, in which
                    students trapped in a high school must murder each other to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 'investigation' segments of the game are almost fully implemented. The 'class trial' part of the
                    game is still early in development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game features 16 unique main characters all designed and drawn by me.

                <p>
                    For my 3rd year project at university, I decided to produce a VR experience. In addition to
                    producing an immersive experience, the aim of this project was to investigate different methods of
                    interaction, as well as the different activities/challenges that could be done in VR, in order to
                    see how they affect a user's immersion levels. This includes the effect things like nausea can have
                    on a player's immersion within VR and the ways they can be alleviated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project was produced in Unity, using the SteamVR plugin.
